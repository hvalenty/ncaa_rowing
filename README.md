Exploratory study on NCAA women's rowing teams.

## Aim 
Leverage webscraping to seamlessly extract roster and lineups data from NCAA women's rowing teams. Use this information to track lineup changes throughout a season to compare with boat performance data. Beginning the study on Duquense's women's team, where I rowed from 2020-2024.


Progressing the study to the UVA women's rowing team. Using a PDF reader tool to extract 2023-2024 compiled results, and collecting historical placement and time data by hand. The PDF extraction is immensly helpful for lineups, which are separated by boat but then rejoined at dataframe by meet. Once pieces of the analysis are coded, functions are implemented to futher optimize the data extraction.

## Techniques
* Web scraping
* PDF text extraction
* Data frame manipulation with pandas
* Text cleaning with string functions
* Regular expression handling
