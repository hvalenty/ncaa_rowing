Study on NCAA women's rowing teams.

## Aim 
Leverage webscraping to seamlessly extract roster and lineups data from NCAA women's rowing teams. Using this information to track lineup changes throughout a season to compare with boat performance data. Beginning the study on Duquense's women's team, where I rowed from 2020-2024.
